## 2. Background
###  What is it about? 
   * Property price prediction is a crucial subject within the realms of real estate and finance. It encompasses the task of forecasting the future values of real estate assets, which can include houses, apartments, commercial properties, and land, by leveraging data and various predictive modeling techniques.


###  Why does it matter?  

   * Property price predictions are important because they affect investment decisions, advise purchasers and sellers, influence real estate development, inform policy decisions, and serve as economic indicators. However, these predictions are loaded with risk and should be considered with other criteria for well-informed decision-making.

###  What are your research questions?
  
   * Essential variables: we seek what variables influence property values, such as location, size, amenities , property type .

   * Model Effectiveness: Evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning models for predicting prices, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) using our dataset and problem you are working with.

## 5. Model Training 

   * Models for Predictive Analytics: After careful consideration, we have chosen the following models for predictive analytics are 
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost
5. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
6. k-nearest neighbors (KNN)

   * Model Training:

1. Train-Test Split: The selected models were trained using an 80/20 train-test split. This allocation ensures a robust training dataset while allowing for effective model evaluation.

2. Python Packages: The predictive models were implemented using popular Python libraries, including scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and analysis.

3. Development Environments: The development was conducted on a local machine, leveraging the computational capabilities of our laptop. Additionally, we utilized Google Colab for collaborative and cloud-based development.

   * Code Implementation:

1. Python Code: The prediction model was implemented in Python, providing a flexible and efficient environment for data analysis and machine learning.

   * Model Performance Evaluation:

1, Evaluation Metrics: The performance of each model was assessed using key metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2).

2. Graphical Representation: The graph below illustrates the performance comparison of the models. Notably, depicts the comparative performance of various models for property price prediction. Decision Tree and Random Forest models exhibit superior accuracy with low MAE and MSE, along with high R-squared values. XGBoost closely follows with competitive accuracy. Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors show moderate performance, while Support Vector Regression (SVR) underperforms, suggesting limitations for this task. Ensemble models, especially Decision Tree and Random Forest, excel, making XGBoost a strong alternative. Caution is advised with SVR, and the graphical representation aids in a clear comparison of model performance metrics.

## 7. Conclusion
   * Conclusion:
In conclusion, our Property Price Prediction study underscores the critical importance of accurate projections for various real estate stakeholders. It highlights the challenges inherent in forecasting property values, emphasizing the necessity for robust data quality and preprocessing. Additionally, recognizing temporal patterns and incorporating risk factors are identified as crucial considerations. Ethical concerns have been addressed, and the study provides valuable insights that can inform real estate decision-making. The findings open avenues for further research and development in this domain.

   * Limitations:
However, it's essential to note that our prediction system is limited to preexisting cities within the dataset and specific property specifications.

   * Lessons Learned:
Throughout this project, we gained valuable experience in building machine learning models and understanding the complexities of predicting property prices.

   * Future Research Direction:
Looking ahead, there is potential for integration with popular real estate websites such as Apartment.com, Zillow, Airbnb, etc. This could extend the model's applicability beyond predefined data, allowing for a more comprehensive and versatile approach to property price prediction. Future research could focus on refining the model for broader usability and addressing new challenges that may arise in the dynamic real estate landscape.
